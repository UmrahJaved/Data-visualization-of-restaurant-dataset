## Description:

This is a collaboration project between Arai-3 in Ghent and Bouman-4 in Brussels, the two cohorts of AI bootcamp learners at BeCode. This challenge is about data visualization and delivering a product to a client. The data provided contains information about restaurants and its customers.
  
## The timeline of the project: 
**Started: 14/03/2022 H:09:30  <br>
  Deadline: 24/03/2022 H:16:30**

## Objectives 
Explore the data for any meaningful patterns and and present the insights to help the business. The goal is to present a dashboard including essential graphs that make sense to the end user. This is done through a presentation with the client on the final day of the project. 
  
## Steps taken to reach the objective:
  * Importing the data from the Azure Cosmos DB cloud to Power BI visualisation tool
  * Data cleaned - fixing the typos, removing the duplicates, identifying and filling the missing values, removing unnecessary information, extracting dates
  * Establishing the relationships between the datasets
  * Creating calculations for sales
  * Constructing the visualisations with Power BI 
  * Drawing conclusions
  * Preparing a dashboard and a presentation for the client

## Visuals <br> 
**For the reasons of the confidentiality, the data provided is ficticious and that leaves us with some surprising results.** 
  
 * Such as more than 75% customers having allergies and these allergens being almost equally distributed among them.

 * Normally we would expect to have a lot more sales in the hospitality industry starting from Friday. With our dataset this is not the case:

 * The sales increase in both cities, but they increase more rapidly in New York than in San Francisco.

## Dashboards 
**While the data has its limitation, we have prepared many more insightful visualisations. Here are the two dashboards we have prepared and we will present them to the client in the interactive mode to the client**
  
* Dashboard referring to general information

* Dashboard referring to restaurant information
